  <h1>Audience Test</h1>
  <article id="test">
    <p>Thank you for volunteering to be part of my audience test! Your feedback is greatly appreciated.
      My project is still a work in progress, so <em>many</em> things are still under devlopement. Therefore, I would like to ask for feedback regarding the navigation, rather than the actual content. A few things to keep in mind before beginning:/p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not use the <strong>refresh</strong> button! It will erase the information you've submitted. Back and forward buttons are okay.</li>
      <li>The story itself is not yet developed, so it most likely won't make a lot of sense.</li>
      <li>The form is still under construction, so only the <strong>name</strong> can be personalized.</li>
      <li>The room exploration section and about page are also under construction, sorry!</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="perform">Now, you're ready to do the perform the test! Please do the following tasks and answer the questions provided.</p>
    <a href="../project/proto3/index.html" target="_blank" id="click">Click here to go to website</a>
    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate at your own pace and try to get to the "congratulations" screen.</li>
      <li>You want to go back to the beginning of the story again. How would you go about doing that?</li>
      <li>Navigate through the story again, but move around to pages that you are more interested in.</li>
      <li>You submitted the form, but want to change the information on it while reading the story. How will you do that?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thank you for finishing the tasks! You are awesome! Now, please answer the following questions (bullet points are okay!):</p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>What do you think this website is about? What do you think is its purpose?</li>
      <li>What did you like about the website?</li>
      <li>What did you find confusing, boring or frustrating?</li>
      <li>Would you prefer the current art style or something more clean and cartoon, like <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mMYb0DiXuoE/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">this?</a></li>
      <li>What other elements do you think can be added to the website?</li>
      <li>Were you aware that you were an elder in the story? When did you realize it?</li>
      <li>Were you able to navigate through the website smoothly? Why or why not?</li>
      <li>Last but not least, did you learn or realize anything through the experience?</li>
    </ol>
