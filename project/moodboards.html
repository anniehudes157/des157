    <h2>Moodboard 1: Illustrative Style</h2>
    <img src="../images/moodboard1.jpg" alt="illustrative style moodboard">
    <p>This is a more illustrative style that may be used for the project. The characters in the story will be draw semi-realistically. While the interior seems to be more of an illustration than realistic style, it is kept three-dimensional rather than
      flat to add realism. This style will be more engaging for the user as the style is similar to a graphic novel and seems more entertaining overall. The color schemes can also be kept consistent since they are drawn and colors can be easily controlled.
      However, the graphics will require a long time to create, as each element will have to be created using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

    <h2>Moodboard 2: Real Life Photos</h2>
    <img src="../images/moodboard2.jpg" alt="real life photo moodboard">
    <p>This moodboard utilizes real life photos to create a narrative. If this is applied, photos of the interior, objects, and characters will be taken by hand or from royalty free sources. Usage of real life photos would help the user connect the story
      to real life more easily. However, it may be less engaging, as the scenes can easily be seen in everyday life outside of the game. It would also be difficult for the lighting of each photo to stay consistent. However, direct usage of the photos
      for the game would be easier than if they were to be illustrated.</p>
