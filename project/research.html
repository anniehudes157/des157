    <h1>Background Research</h1>
    <h2>Experiences of the Elderly, Immigrants, and Disabled</h2>
    <p>For the final project, I am planning to create an interactive game that would give
      the users an idea of someone else’s live. My hope is that the will allow the users
      to gain a wider perspective of the world. Currently, I am deciding between depicting
      the lives of elders, immigrants, and people with disabilities. Therefore, I decided
      to research the difficulties that they may have in life.
    </p>
    <p>In “Challenges Facing the Elderly”, the article mentions several difficulties that
      elders may be experiencing, but goes by unnoticed by the general public. One is the
      existence of “ageism”, in which people discriminate others based on their age. While
      many people treat the elderly in a kinder way due to their perceived fragility or their
      resemblance to their grandmother, there have also been cases where elderly women become
      the target of scams and robberies. Another major problem that is not often emphasized
      in media is the mistreatment of and abuse of elders. As the elderly become physically
      weaker and more dependent on others, the chances of them being abused increases.
      According to two US studies, one out of ten elders have indicated at least one type
      of elder abuse (Lumen Learning). This high, surprising fact increases the need to become
      aware of the problems elders face everyday.
    </p>
    <p>To further understanding the mind of elderly people, I also read an academic study that
      explores the health and social problems of the Elderly. More than two hundred people
      participated for the study, contributing to test results that were quite unexpected results.
      The results indicated that the most common health problems for elders include hypertension,
      osteoarthritis, diabetes, or bronchial asthma. Cataract, anemia, and skin problems were also
      present in the survey takers. The study also discussed the fact that half of the subjects
      felt that they were neglected by their family, and more than one third felt that they were
      burdening their family. Despite the surprising results, it is also important to take not
      that this was a small sample of elders in India, which may or may not be different from
      the United States.
    </p>
    <p>Besides the elderly, I also wanted to know more about the lives of immigrants in the
      United States, as I myself is an immigrant and have faced many challenges in the past as
      well. This issue is becoming more relevant as Donald Trump proposes to create a wall to
      stop illegal immigrants from crossing the border. From the article written by Christina Nuñez,
      it is revealed that the access to various services is a great challenge for immigrants,
      especially those who are undocumented. There is often a language barrier and stops the
      immigrants from getting the proper services that they need. This presents a large problem
      as many immigrants suffer from stress and mental health issues, but are unable to get the
      help they need. This is a greatly unfair situation as most immigrants intend to work hard
      in order to gain opportunities for their children to have better lives.
    </p>
    <p>Another topic I wanted to explore was people with disabilities. An article by The Daily
      Dot explores the issues that people with disability are currently facing. As someone that
      usually does not pay a lot of attention to this group of people, the article was an eye-opening
      experience. One large problem that people with disabilities are facing is the lack of funding
      for the group, which will greatly affect their lifestyle. It was surprising to discover that
      disabled people are also, unfortunately, victims of police brutality. Other problems amongst
      people with disabilities include a large employment gap and the issue of being placed in
      special education due to their disabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research on the elderly, immigrants, and people with disabilities has given me a better
      understanding of what they are going through everyday. These ideas will help to further
      develop my final project as I intend to create an immersive experience that will stay
      true to the realistic problems that these groups of people face.
