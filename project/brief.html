    <h1>Project Brief - What will happen when we grow old?</h1>
    <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
    <p>When thinking of mental health, the elderly is an unlikely age group to come to mind. However, it is important to note that they also suffer from mental illnesses, as 1 out of 5 Americans is projected to be an elder by year 2050 (US Census Bureau).
      Upon researching the problems elders face, I found out that signs of depression in elders are often overlooked, and that a main cause for this is the feeling of loneliness and neglect that they have. This is due to the lack of meaningful time that they are
      able to spend with their loved ones. To solve this problem, I believe that it is important to make the elders' family members aware of this problem. Through this project, I aim to produce an interactive game that will allow the user to live a day through the perspective of a
      typical elder. By doing so, people are able to sympathize with the situations of older people and become more likely to spent time with elders in their family.
    </p>
    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>The primary target audience of this project would be middle-aged working adults. This target population has a regular 6-day working schedule, and has little time to relax. For an hour or two before bed, they tend to catch up with the new on the internet before
      they go to bed. Being in the middle class allows them to live a comfortable life with their family. On their day off, they would go out with their family. However, they would typically leave their parents at home, as it is tiring for them to walk around for a long
      time. While they are able to provide their parents a comfortable life with their fairly good salary, they are reluctant to spent time with them as they are always on the go. By exposing knowledge to the target audience, I hope for them to become more well aware of the importance
      of mental health for elders and begin to engage in more meaningful conversations with them.

      My secondary audience would be anyone who is interested in the lives of the elderly and would like to contribute to improving their mental health. The secondary audience can help solve the problem by becoming companions of elders as well, or supporting by donating to institutions
      that deal with the mental health of elders.
    </p>
    <h2>Goals of the Project</h2>
    <p>The main objective of this project is to bring awareness of the difficulties elders may face each day. An effective way to do so is to immerse oneself into their lives. The browser will act as the "eyes" of the user, as he or she navigates around a house
      to explore and perform activities for a set amount of time. The game will begin with a first-person conversation with family members. The user, playing the role of an elder, says his or her goodbyes to the family members as they set off to school or work. The user
      then proceeds to spent the rest the day doing activities in the house. The game will incorporate typical rooms for the user to navigate through, along with personal items that help create a narrative for the user's role as an elder whose spouse had recently passed away.
      For a more realistic experience. It will also incorporate the deteriorating physical abilities a typical elder would have, such as blurred vision, slower movements, and a shorter memory span. The mouse and keyboard will be used to navigate through the game.
    </p>
    <h2>Visual Strategies</h2>
    <p>To portray the real world more accurately, the general appearance of the game will be of vector images created based on real photos. To establish the atmosphere of the game, scenes with the family members will be shown brighter to represent happiness and companionship,
      while the scenes with the user alone will be darker and more faded to represent loneliness and isolation. Scenes with family members would appear in a warmer tone, while scenes alone would have a cooler tone. To maintain consistency and legibility, a san serif font will be used, and text will appear at the bottom of the screen. The time can be seen at the top left of the screen to simulate
      the passage of time. To explain certain elements of the game to the user, a small text box will fade in consistently at the top right corner. Clickable items will be outlined when hovered
      over. When use of keyboard is necessary, instructions will appear. To create stimulate slow movement, a loading bar will appear whenever the user performs a task. Short memory span can be stimulated through a mini game in which the user needs to search for a phrase amongst other phrases.
      Ideally, I hope for the overall mood of the game to convey a feeling of loneliness and longing for companionship that many elders feel.
