    <p>Decisions that Matter, a game created by a group of students at Carnegie Mellon University, is an interactive experience that teaches people about making proper decisions to prevent sexual assault. The player plays the role of a college student who
      makes decisions that will eventually prevent or allow sexual assault to take place. The main audience of this website are college students, as the story takes place at a college party. This game is a new experience from other websites due to its
      personalization and interactivity.
    </p>

    <p>As you begin the game, you are asked to input your name to make the appear more personalized and relatable. The story is laid out in a comic-like style, which helps to keep the story entertaining for the users. It also uses a first person perspective,
      which adds to the realness of the story. Animations such as reading incoming texts, as well as the occasional sounds recorded from the real world, also make the game more realistic. As you play the game, there are critical checkpoints where a decision
      has to be made under a set amount of time. This reflects what happens in real life, as you do not have time to hesitate in times of emergency. At the top right, there is a button that reveals the profiles of the characters, along with a page that
      mimics the Facebook feed. The end of the game is the most shocking, as the characters in the story comes to life and transitions into real people who gives a speech to the player about the incident.

    <p>
      Although there is little interactivity for the user, the simplicity of the game allows the player to focus more on the story, an action that the creators aim to highlight. Overall, the game has an easy-to-navigate interface. It has a consistent layout
      of where certain buttons would be. For example, the next button is maintained at the bottom right so that players are able to move forward when they are ready. The buttons, while resembling a speech bubble, are color coded to be distinguished from
      regular speech bubbles. Through the first person point of view, timed decisions, and one-on-one conversations, the game successfully gives the player a memorable experience about sexual assault.

    <h2>Animal Research, Let's Get Into It!</h2>

    <p>
      Cobay.es, an interactive website made by French designers, explains the various procedures behind animal testing. In the website you are able to learn about the steps to animal testing by trying to do so yourself. The short interactive game allows the
      users to get a sense of the strict regulations behind animal testing that many may not be aware of. The experience stands out from others through the use of 3D models and the use of two devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      The website first catches the user’s attention by showing an animation of a lab rat being constructed from white fragments. Next, a list of misconceptions about animal research are revealed to help the user prepare for the experience. This gives the user
      a context of what the website’s objective is. As you begin the actual experience of animal testing, you are asked to perform various actions, such as submitting an application to the ethics committee, through the holding of the spacebar. Doing so
      creates a more engaging experience for the user, as they will be focused on the screen while they are holding the key. When it is time to dissect the lab rat, the user is asked to enter a passcode obtained through navigating the link on a smartphone.
      Lastly, the user interacts with the rat to anesthetize and sterilize it. This is the most immersive part of the game, as the user interacts with a 3d mouse model, making the situation more realistic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, the website is fairly easy to navigate. Animation and arrows are added to help direct the user to the buttons, and emphasized words are bolded and in bigger fonts. The font sizes, however, can be larger. It will also be more helpful if the link
      provided for the passcode can be easily copied and pasted.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the game contains many aspects that keep the users engaged, the requirement of having to use two devices at the same time can be inconvenient for many users. Although the idea is unique it can be bothersome for the user depending on how they accessed
      the website. If the users are already on their phone or have only one device, the game may be halted, ruining the user’s experience. While opening a new tab is possible, it is confusing as the two windows are meant to work simultaneously to create
      the experience.
